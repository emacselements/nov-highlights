# nov-highlights: Highlights and Annotations for Nov Mode

`nov-highlights` is an Emacs package that adds powerful highlighting and annotation features to Nov Mode (the EPUB reader for Emacs). With this package, you can:

- Highlight text in green, orange, purple, pink, blue underline, or red strikeout
- Add annotations to highlighted text (creates a yellow highlight with a note)
- Export all highlights and annotations to Org mode or Markdown files
- Persistently store highlights and annotations across sessions
- **Highlights persist even if you move or rename your epub files!**

This makes it easy to mark up, annotate, and review your eBooks directly within Emacs.

## Key Features

**Stable Highlight Storage**: Highlights are tied to book metadata (title and author), not file paths. This means your annotations and highlights will persist even if you:
- Move epub files to different directories
- Rename epub files
- Sync books across different machines

The highlights are stored in `~/.emacs.d/nov-highlights.el` by default.

## Configuration

### Annotation Mode

By default, annotations are edited and viewed in **Markdown mode**. You can customize this to use Org mode or plain text.

Add to `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

```elisp
;; Markdown (default - no config needed)
(setq nov-highlights-annotation-mode 'markdown-mode)

;; Or switch to Org mode
(setq nov-highlights-annotation-mode 'org-mode)

;; Or plain text
(setq nov-highlights-annotation-mode 'text-mode)
```

**Note**: This only affects the editing experience - annotations are stored as plain text, so existing annotations will work regardless of which mode you choose.

## Migration for Existing Users

If you were using an older version of nov-highlights and have existing highlights, you have two options:

### Option 1: Start Fresh (Recommended if you have few highlights)
Simply delete the old database and start over:
```bash
rm ~/.emacs.d/nov-highlights.el
```
New highlights will automatically use the metadata-based storage system.

### Option 2: Migrate Per-Book
If you have many highlights to preserve:

1. Open an epub file that has highlights
2. Run: `M-x nov-highlights-migrate-current-book`

This will find highlights stored under the old filename and migrate them to use the book's metadata (title + author). Repeat for each book with highlights you want to keep.

**Note**: After migration, your highlights will be tied to the book's metadata instead of file paths, so they'll persist across file moves and renames.

## Zoom commands (in Nov mode):

nov-zoom-in	    `C-+` or `C-=`  
nov-zoom-out	`C--`  
nov-zoom-reset	`C-0`
